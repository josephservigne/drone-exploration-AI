# AI Drone Exploration - FUEL Algorithm (Simplified Version)

**The project focuses on the autonomous exploration in 2D of a virtual environment simulated in PyBullet by a drone in Python.**

## Context

This project was developed as part of a semester-long academic project at CentraleSupelec. Our client was the start-up **Drakkair**, composed of three students/researchers:  
- Nicolas Rosal (CEO)  
- Cl√©ment Mauget (CTO)  
- Kenzy Barakat (intern and our main contact, currently in the 3rd year at CentraleSup√©lec)

The goal was to support Drakkair in developing two algorithms: **FUEL** and **DPPM**. Although the project involved both, **this repository only contains the FUEL algorithm**, as it is the one I contributed to directly. The related paper can be found as `FUEL.pdf` in the repository.

While a public GitHub repository existed for the FUEL implementation, we decided to start from scratch due to the poor structure of that codebase (+ it was mostly written in C). Additionally, we chose to **restrict the environment to two dimensions** to simplify data processing.

The result is a **clean, understandable, and maintainable version of the FUEL algorithm**, designed to serve as a first deliverable for our client.

‚ö†Ô∏è This project is still under development. In particular, the current implementation handles sensor noise poorly, which affects the robustness and performance of the exploration algorithm.
